Not only does the Huskers consistently have losing seasons, but there is no sign of improvement at all compared to the other Big Ten Teams. Almost all the other teams have made some improvement in the Big Ten rankings, but the Huskers have not at all.\n\n\nCode\n bubble <- bigtenbasketball %>%\n  group_by(School) %>%\n  summarise(\n    averageSRS = mean(SRS),\n    averageSOS = mean(SOS),\n    Wins = sum(totalwins)\n  )\n\nne <- bubble %>% filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bubble, aes(x=averageSRS,y=averageSOS, size=Wins),\n    color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=ne, aes(x=averageSRS,y=averageSOS, size=Wins),\n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 13.98262) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10,32548) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bubble,\n    aes(x=averageSRS, y=averageSOS, label=School), size=3) +\n  geom_encircle(data=ne, aes(x=averageSRS+.9, y=averageSOS), s_shape=.01, expand=.000001, colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4.5, y=9.8, label=\"Average SOS\"), size=3, color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_text(aes(x=15.3, y=8, label=\"Average SRS\"), size=3, color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Simple Rating System\",\n    y=\"Strength Of Schedule\",\n    title=\"Nebraska can't win games with Hoiberg\",\n    subtitle=\"Even though they have an above average strength of schedule, they still have a poor rating and can't win\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Naren Narasimhan\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could say Nebraska doesn’t win a lot of games because of their competition in the Big Ten and their strength of schedule. However, all Big Ten teams have had similar strength of schedules or harder for the last three years so this argument is irrelevant. The Huskers also have the worst simple rating system in the Big Ten by far compared to the other teams. A simple rating system is a rating based on average point differential and strength of schedule. In essence, this means that Nebraska plays horrible compared to bad and good teams in general.\n\n\nCode\nstack <- bigtenbasketball %>%\n  group_by(School) %>%\n  summarise(\n    fieldgoalpercent = mean(`FG%`),\n    efficientfieldgoalpercent = mean(`eFG%`)\n  )\n\nstacked <- stack %>%\n  select(\n    School, fieldgoalpercent, efficientfieldgoalpercent\n  )\n\nstackedwide <- stacked %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=c(\"fieldgoalpercent\", \"efficientfieldgoalpercent\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"percent\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=stackedwide, aes(x=reorder(School, percent), weight=percent, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"orange\"), labels=c(\"Efficient field goal%\", \"Field goal%\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Percentage\",\n    title=\"Hoiberg's famed shooting offense doesn't work for Nebraska\",\n    subtitle=\"The Huskers have one of the worst overall shooting percentages in the Big Ten for the last three years\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Naren Narasimhan\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone knows coach Hoiberg for his fast-paced offense and that’s what he planned to bring to the Huskers. It worked well at Iowa State, but it completely flopped in the NBA. There was high hope for this offense because Hoiberg was back in the college basketball scene, but there is little optimism now. Nebraska ranks 2nd to last in the Big Ten for the last 3 years for field goal percentage and efficient field goal. Not only have the Huskers been losing games, but they can’t even make any shots to go with that. Maybe Hoiberg should start spending some time recutting a 7’0” center for the first time in his life.\n\n\nCode\ndumbell <- bigtenbasketball %>%\n  group_by(School) %>%\n  summarise(\n    offensiverating = mean(ORtg),\n    defensiverating = mean(DRtg)\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=dumbell, aes(y=reorder(School, offensiverating), x=offensiverating, xend=defensiverating),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Offensive Rating (Green) vs. Defesnive Rating (Red)\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"The Huskers have the worst offesnive and defensive rating\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska and Northwestern are the only teams in that have their offensive and defesnive ratings inverted\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Naren Narasimhan\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, Nebraska has the worst offensive and defensive ratings in the Big Ten by far in the last 3 years. Offensive efficiency means how efficient a team is at producing points for their team. Defensive efficiency is the complete opposite where it shows how efficient your team is at not letting your opponent score. You want a higher offensive efficiency and a lower defensive efficiency. Nebraska and Northwestern are the only Big Ten Teams with a lower offensive efficiency than defensive, which results in a negative net efficiency.\nClearly, the Huskers have some work to do if they want to compete in the Big Ten. Obviously, kicking them out of the Big Ten is not realistic so what can they do? A new coach and new offense hasn’t been working. A 5 star freshman also didn’t make a difference. What dramatic change can the Huskers make to revive this basketball team?"
